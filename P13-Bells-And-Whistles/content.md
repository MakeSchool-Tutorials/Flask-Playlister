If you're looking for some extra challenges, there are a few more things we can do to tighten up our website and make it look more like the big leagues. Let's look at a few.

# Displaying "Created At" Time

Let's display a "timestamp" for when a Review was created that looks like this: "Created on August 18, 2019 at 2:03 PM".

First we will need to add a 'created_at' field to our data model and store it in MongoDB when a review is created. Let's do that now.

> [action]
>
> Update the 'show' route in `app.py` to add a timestamp indicating when the review was created:
>
```python
@app.route('/reviews', methods=['POST'])
def reviews_submit():
    """Submit a new review."""
    review = {
        'title': request.form.get('title'),
        'movieTitle': request.form.get('movieTitle'),
        'description': request.form.get('description'),
        'created_at': datetime.now()
    }
    print(review)
    review_id = reviews.insert_one(review).inserted_id
    return redirect(url_for('reviews_show', review_id=review_id))
```

Now we can display that `created_at` timestamp in our html:

> [action]
>
> Update `templates/reviews_show.html` to include the `created_at` field right below the `title`:
>
```HTML
...
>
<h1>{{ review.title }}</h1>
<p class='text-muted'>Created on: {{ review.created_at }}</p>
>
...
```

Now create a new review and see what is displayed.

Uh-oh - what you see there is called a Unix timestamp.

`2019-08-19 05:14:58.038000`

It *technically* says the date and time when the review was created, but it isn't very readable for humans!

# Formatting Timestamps

To parse our `datetime` object into something more readable, let's use its `strftime` function. We can specify what format we want our datetime to be in using **format codes** such as `%Y`, `%m`, and `%d` to represent the year, month, and day respectively. Let's try it out now!

> [action]
>
> Update the `reviews_show` template:
>
>
```html
<!-- templates/reviews_show.html -->
>
<h1>{{review.title}}</h1>
<p class='text-muted'>Created on {{ review.created_at.strftime('%A, %d %B, %Y') }}
    at {{ review.created_at.strftime('%I:%M %p') }}</p>
```

Reload your browser and check the timestamp. Pretty cool, huh?

# Adding a Footer

Now let's add a footer (brought to you by mdbootstrap.com). Add the following code after the `{% block content %}` tag but before the `</body>` tag or any `<script>` tags.

> [action]
>
> Add the following code after the `{% block content %}` tag, but before the `</body>` tag or any `<script>` tags in `templates/base.html`.
>
```html
<!-- templates/base.html -->
...
>
<!-- Footer -->
<footer class='page-footer font-small blue pt-4'>
    <div class='container-fluid text-center'>
         <div class='row'>
         <hr class='clearfix w-100 d-md-none pb-3'>
         <div class='col-md-6 mb-md-0 mb-3'>
             <h5 class='text-uppercase'>Links</h5>
             <ul class='list-unstyled'>
                 <li><a href='#!'>Link 1</a></li>
                 <li><a href='#!'>Link 2</a></li>
                 <li><a href='#!'>Link 3</a></li>
                 <li><a href='#!'>Link 4</a></li>
             </ul>
         </div>
         <div class='col-md-6 mb-md-0 mb-3'>
             <h5 class='text-uppercase'>Links</h5>
             <ul class='list-unstyled'>
                 <li><a href='#!'>Link 1</a></li>
                 <li><a href='#!'>Link 2</a></li>
                 <li><a href='#!'>Link 3</a></li>
                 <li><a href='#!'>Link 4</a></li>
             </ul>
         </div>
         </div>
    </div>
    <div class='footer-copyright text-center py-3'>Â© 2018 Copyright:
       <a href='https://mdbootstrap.com/education/bootstrap/'> MDBootstrap.com</a>
    </div>
</footer>
>
...
```

Beautiful. Make any visual changes you like.


# Adding a Bootstrap Theme

Now if we want to customize our style a little bit, we can add a free bootstrap theme. One popular website for finding these is called [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).

You can pick whichever you like, but for these instructions we'll use the "flatly" theme.

> [action]
> Go to [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) and select a theme from the `Themes` dropdown
>
> Select the dropdown of the name of the style you selected. For example, if you like the `Flatly` style, you should see a `Flatly` dropdown as the last nav bar item on the left
>
> Select the `bootstrap.min.css` option in the dropdown
> Copy the URL into your `<head>` tag to include the style you want. Make sure that this theme comes AFTER your link to bootstrap itself. Otherwise it won't work.
>
```html
<head>
  ...
>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='https://bootswatch.com/4/flatly/bootstrap.min.css'>
</head>
```

Now you can mess around with the CSS classes you have previously applied to achieve the look that you want!. Note that this will cause some areas of the app to look a _lot_ different from what we initially did. But all of it is adjustable with some additional CSS!

# Now Commit

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'added created_at, footer, and bootstrap theme'
$ git push
```
